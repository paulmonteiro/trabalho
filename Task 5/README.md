This task objective is:

Given several ordered lists of positive integers, determine the smallest range of integers that is common to all lists.

Example Input:
[[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]

Output:
[20,24]

Explanation:
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 belong to the interval [20,24]
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 belong to the interval [20,24]
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 belong to the interval [20,24]
